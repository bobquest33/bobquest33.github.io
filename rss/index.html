My tumbler blog basically is for the stuffs that I read over the internet and is synced with my Twitter. My Blogger account and Wordpress accouts have been lying idle for a while. 

<p>My Githib blog that was based on octopress had been also lying idle and had a old design. Hence I thought which can be the best way to restart my technical blogging as I am dedicating 2015 for blogging. The first contender was <strong>Ghost</strong>. Its simplicity and ease of use has made me love it and also it means I can host it anytime I want.</p>

<p>I am using the below links to setup Ghost using docker and buster. And using these to publish my blog in github.</p>

<ul>
<li>Docker &amp; Ghost Installation</li>

<li>Static site generation with Ghost &amp; Buster

</ul>

<p>If you are seeing this then its written out of Docker-Ghost and extracted and deployed via Buster.</p>]]&gt;</description><link>http://bobquest33.github.io/new-year-with-ghost-and-buster/<guid ispermalink="false">ae805a91-0392-4e1a-abd8-e4379c30afad</guid><creator></creator><pubdate>Sat, 03 Jan 2015 08:32:27 GMT</pubdate></item></channel>
