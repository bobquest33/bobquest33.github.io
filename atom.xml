    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Behind every success there is a painful experience of successive failures.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Learned about lean startup process, also concepts about customer centered business development process. And how a clear idea, pivots, one page business plan and an iterative process of customer interaction can bring about a big change in the way we start a business today. My only goal for the next few weeks will be to develop my minimum viable product and getting it online. If you still not make any head or tail of my ideas, then &nbsp;keep waiting for my next posts where I will write my experiences about making a startup.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that with a clear vision, by proper planning and by my resolve to take risks I will be able to succeed in starting my first startup.</p>

<p>So keep waiting for my next posts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the eve of Christmas I thought of wtriting a script that can find all the best Christmas jokes and receipies available on the web. It will be fun to automate such a script which I can also use in future as well. This will involve writing a script
in Ruby, Mechanize, Nokogiri and finding the matches for our search criteria and showing it to the screen.</p>

<p>As a further work we can also use to save the output to a mongo db and if possible show it as a webpage.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my quest for better blogging engines and ways of hacking my way through to create a automated blog.
I stumbled upon Octopress. The combination of ruby, jekyll, sinatra  and the beauty of commandline makes
Octopress a nice way to try at blogging for me. The most important aspect for me to use
this blog engine is to use my favorite text editor while typing my blog and running
some cool commandline rake tasks to publish it. Hope I get chance to write more and more
blogs using Octopress.</p>
